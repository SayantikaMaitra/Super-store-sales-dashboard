A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

Problem Statement/Use Case

The assignment uses data of superstore sales provided in .xlsx format.
It is required to prepare a single view sales dashboard highlighting important KPIs that would help the sales managers analyze their territory sales.

Focus on following pointers while creating the report:

Ø It should cover all the major metrics which a manager would be interested in seeing
Ø There is a separate tab for returns. Even that should be included in the report. (You need to create a relationship before you can use it within report)
Ø A manager should see data only for his region.
Ø The tiles (visuals) should be interactive, and slice and dice options should be available across categories, orders, and dates.
Ø The report could be in one page or can span across multiple pages
Ø Custom visuals can be included wherever appropriate.
Ø Once the report is prepared, publish it to Power BI service and share it with the evaluator or share the report (.pbix) file
Ø Make appropriate assumptions wherever required
